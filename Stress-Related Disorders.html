        <h2>Stress-Related Disorders</h2>
        <p>Stress-Related Disorders, also known as adjustment disorders, are a group of conditions that occur in response to a significant life stressor. These stressors can include major life changes, traumatic events, or ongoing difficulties in life situations.</p>

        <h3>Symptoms of Stress-Related Disorders</h3>

            <li><strong>Behavioral Changes:</strong> Impaired social or occupational functioning, withdrawal from normal activities, or changes in relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Symptoms:</strong> Headaches, stomachaches, muscle tension, and other physical complaints without a clear medical cause.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty Coping:</strong> Challenges in adapting to or coping with the stressor, leading to functional impairment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
        <p>Diagnosing stress-related disorders involves a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional. Treatment options may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Counseling and talk therapy to explore and address the underlying causes of stress and develop coping strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> In some cases, short-term use of medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as anxiety or depression.</li>
            <li><strong>Supportive Interventions:</strong> Building a strong support network, including friends, family, and community resources, can be essential for recovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Coping Strategies</h3>
        <p>Managing stress-related disorders involves developing effective coping strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stress Management Techniques:</strong> Learning and practicing stress reduction techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Management:</strong> Organizing and prioritizing tasks to reduce feelings of overwhelm.</li>
            <li><strong>Positive Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Incorporating healthy habits, such as regular exercise, sufficient sleep, and a balanced diet.</li>
        </ul>

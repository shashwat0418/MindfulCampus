             <strong>Puberty:</strong>Puberty is a significant developmental stage marked by various physical, emotional, and psychological changes. While it's a normal and natural part of growing up, it can also bring about mental health challenges for some individuals. Adolescents undergoing puberty experience a surge in hormonal changes that can impact their emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. Mental health issues during this time can be influenced by a combination of biological, environmental, and social factors.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Depression: </strong>Puberty is a period where susceptibility to depression increases. The hormonal changes, coupled with social and academic pressures, can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities once enjoyed. 
         </p>
         <p><strong> Anxiety Disorders:</strong>Adolescents may experience heightened levels of anxiety during puberty. It can manifest as generalized anxiety, social anxiety, or specific phobias, often due to increased stress, changing social dynamics, or concerns about body image and acceptance among peers. 
         </p>
         <p><strong>Mood Swings: </strong>Fluctuations in hormones during puberty can lead to abrupt changes in mood. These swings can be more pronounced during this phase, causing emotional highs and lows that might be challenging to manage. 
         </p>
         <p><strong>Substance Abuse:</strong>Experimentation or increased use of substances like alcohol, tobacco, or drugs might occur during adolescence. This behaviour is often associated with peer influence, curiosity, or an attempt to cope with emotional difficulties.</p>
         <p><strong>Social challenges and peer pressure: </strong>Social interactions can be both enriching and challenging. Bullying, peer pressure, and feelings of social exclusion can have profound effects on a child's mental well-being.
         </p>
         <p><strong>ADHD:</strong>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Conduct Disorders: Some individuals might exhibit symptoms related to ADHD or conduct disorders, causing difficulties in concentration, impulsivity, and behavioural challenges. 
             Social isolation: Feelings of loneliness and social isolation can contribute to mental health issues.
         </p>
         <p><strong>EXTRA:</strong>Eating disorders, self-esteem and body image issues, and self-harm and suicidal ideation are some other problems related with puberty.

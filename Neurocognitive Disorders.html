        <h2>Neurocognitive Disorders</h2>
        <p>Neurocognitive Disorders, formerly known as dementia, are a group of conditions characterized by significant cognitive decline that interferes with daily functioning. These disorders affect memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior.</p>

        <h3>Common Types of Neurocognitive Disorders</h3>
        <p>Key types of neurocognitive disorders include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> The most common cause of dementia, characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Vascular Dementia:</strong> Caused by impaired blood flow to the brain, resulting in cognitive decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Lewy Body Dementia:</strong> Involves abnormal protein deposits in the brain, leading to cognitive and motor symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Frontotemporal Dementia:</strong> A group of disorders affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality and behavior.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Symptoms and Progression</h3>
        <p>Symptoms of neurocognitive disorders may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Loss:</strong> Forgetfulness and difficulty retaining new information.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Impairment:</strong> Challenges in reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Difficulties:</strong> Difficulty with communication, including speaking, writing, and understanding language.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Changes:</strong> Changes in mood, personality, and social interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Neurocognitive disorders typically progress over time, and the severity of symptoms can vary. Early diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management and support.</p>

        <h3>Diagnosis and Management</h3>
        <p>Diagnosing neurocognitive disorders involves a comprehensive evaluation by healthcare professionals, including cognitive testing and imaging studies. While there is no cure, management may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Certain medications may help manage symptoms and slow the progression of some neurocognitive disorders.</li>
            <li><strong>Therapy and Support:</strong> Cognitive rehabilitation and supportive interventions can enhance daily functioning and quality of life.</li>
            <li><strong>Family and Caregiver Support:</strong> Providing education and support for families and caregivers is essential for managing the challenges associated with neurocognitive disorders.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of a neurocognitive disorder, seeking professional help for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care is crucial. Supportive care and interventions can enhance the quality of life for individuals affected by these disorders.</em></p>
